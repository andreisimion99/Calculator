  The purpose of the homework is to write a calculator that takes its input from the command line parameters. The calculator will support the following operations: absolute, addition, division, help, maximum, minimum, modulo, multiply, power, reverse, sort, sqrt, subtraction, unique, sinus, cosinus.

  To solve this homework I used Visual Studio Code (editor, compiler and terminal).
  First, I made a new directory, in which I opened a new file, with the help of the above program. I saved it as a Java Script file, and then created the "package.json" file using the Visual Studio Code terminal. I entered in it all the necessary data. Then, I imported the "cowsay" library to display the logo later.
  Next, we started solving the requirements, taking over the arguments of a command using process.argv and removing the first two elements from it (the two addresses not being necessary).
  We then checked the number of elements in the process.argv and associated with a variable the value of the last element, this representing the name of the operation (+, -, etc.).
  To solve each operation, we used a switch structure, assigning a case to each operation, by checking the variable mentioned above. At the end of it, in case of "default", the error display for the unidentified command is present.
  In each "case" are found both the solutions of each operation, as well as the errors in case the number of terms does not correspond to the rules in the requirement.
